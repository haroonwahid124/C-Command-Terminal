# C Command Terminal (Linux)

This project is a group assignment in which we developed a custom command-line terminal in C for Linux. The terminal allows users to interact with the system by prompting for input, reading and parsing commands, and exiting gracefully. On startup, it initializes the working directory and supports executing external commands, as well as setting the current directory to Home and managing the PATH environment variable.

Users can navigate the file system using cd commands, and the terminal maintains a command history. Commands can be added to history, invoked from history, and printed, with persistent history functionality that loads and saves command records across sessions. The terminal also supports aliases, allowing users to add, remove, invoke, and list all aliases, with persistent storage so that aliases are retained between sessions.

This project was developed collaboratively to practice systems programming, process management, file navigation, and teamwork. While it mimics many Linux terminal features, it is intended for educational purposes, and some commands may behave differently than in a standard Linux shell.
